                I once had a girl
                Or should I say she once had me
                She showed me her room
                Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
                She asked me to stay
                And she told me to sit anywhere
                So I looked around
                And I noticed there wasn't a chair
                I sat on a rug biding my time
                Drinking her wine
                We talked until two and then she said
                "It's time for bed"
                She told me she worked
                In the morning and started to laugh
                I told her I didn't
                And crawled off to sleep in the bath
                And when I awoke I was alone
                This bird had flown
                So I lit a fire
                Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

                Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
                Now it looks as though they're here to stay
                Oh, I believe in yesterday.

                Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
                There's a shadow hanging over me.
                Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

                Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
                I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

                Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
                Now I need a place to hide away.
                Oh, I believe in yesterday.

                Mm mm mm mm mm.

                I can remember when we walked together
                Sharing a love I thought would last forever
                Moonlight to show the way so we can follow
                Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow
                Then something changed her mind, her kisses told me
                I had no loving arms to hold me
                Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
                Knowing that it's cloudy above
                Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
                Lonely is a man without love
                I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me
                So if you see my girl, please send her home to me
                Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying
                Say I can't stop myself from crying
                Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
                Knowing that it's cloudy above
                Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
                Lonely is a man without love
                Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
